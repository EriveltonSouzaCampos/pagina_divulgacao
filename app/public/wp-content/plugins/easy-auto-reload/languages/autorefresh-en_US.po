"This field is used to define the lifespan of nonces in seconds. By default, "
"nonces have a lifespan of 86,400 seconds, which is equivalent to one day. "
"It's important to exercise caution when considering any extensions to this "
"value, as longer lifespans may introduce security risks by extending the "
"window of opportunity for potential attacks. Please ensure you carefully "
"assess your security requirements before making changes to this setting."
